The heatset inserts would be placed in all the holds to keep the case together and keep the pcb board in place!
I have items poking out both the front side and the backside, so I'll need to be careful about that when assembling the entire thing. I'll also look into creating adding depressiosn for all the diodes and the XIAO, but thats for later.
